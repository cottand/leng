If leng.toml is not found the default configuration will be used. If it is found, fields that are set will act as overrides.

## Quick Start

If you are happy to use Cloudflare as your upstream DNS provider and just want to generally block tracking
and advertising, the following minimal config should be enough.

If you want to tweak more settings, keep scrolling down!

```toml
# address to bind to for the DNS server
bind = "0.0.0.0:53"

# address to bind to for the API server
api = "127.0.0.1:8080"

# manual custom dns entries - comments for reference
customdnsrecords = [
    # "example.mywebsite.tld      IN A       10.0.0.1",
]

[Metrics]
    enabled = false

[Blocking]
    # manual whitelist entries - comments for reference
    whitelist = [
        # "getsentry.com",
    ]
```

## Default configuration

```toml
# log configuration
# format: comma separated list of options, where options is one of 
#   file:<filename>@<loglevel>
#   stderr>@<loglevel>
#   syslog@<loglevel>
# loglevel: 0 = errors and important operations, 1 = dns queries, 2 = debug
# e.g. logconfig = "file:leng.log@2,syslog@1,stderr@2"
logconfig = "stderr@2"

# apidebug enables the debug mode of the http api library
apidebug = false

# address to bind to for the DNS server
bind = "0.0.0.0:53"

# address to bind to for the API server
api = "127.0.0.1:8080"

# concurrency interval for lookups in milliseconds
interval = 200

# question cache capacity, 0 for infinite but not recommended (this is used for storing logs)

    # "example.other.tld          IN CNAME   wikipedia.org"
]

# How deep to follow chains of CNAME records
# set to 0 to disable CNAME-following entirely
